	<h1>The Miracle of the Flying Moss</h1>
	Flying moss is a miracle!<br>
	<p>One of the more magnificent things that scientists have found in our wonderfully weird world is the Flying Moss of Cumulo. These balls of moss much, much like<br>
	Marimo moss balls of Japan, endlessly roll around finding the best spot to collect the suns rays to feed themselves. The strange thing that scientist still<br>
	have not been able to explain is that these moss balls move around thousands of feet up in the air, moving from one mass of water particulates that we call<br>
	clouds to the next.</p>

	<p>These moss balls although closly related to the Marimo moss balls of Japan are very different. They move from cloud formation to cloud formation using<br> 
	the jet stream instead of water currents to push them. Obviously this means they grow much smaller then the Marimo moss balls which have been known to <br>
	grow as large as 12". The largest Flying moss ball recovered by scientists was only 0.25" while most of them averaged around 0.1". You may be wondering how<br>
	scientist even knew to look for these small interesting creatures. Over the last 20 years there has been several reports of planes striking a patch of<br>
	greenery during take off or landing. Most pilots chalked this up to a group of oddly colored bugs but one daring scientist, Heir Ulga Von Hammerschmidt, wanted<br>
	to investigate this phenomenon more closely. Through her careful observations she was able to identify the cellular structure similarly resembling the<br>
	structure of the Marimo moss balls.</p>

	<p>After this facinating discovery by Heir Ulga, scientist chartered private planes to attempt to collect some living specimens. These efforts resulted in the<br>
	first ever captive Flying moss specimens collected by the Univerity of Hawaii.</p>
