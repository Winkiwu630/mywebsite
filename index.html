	<h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;"><strong>The Coding Newbies first web page!!!</strong></h1>

	<h2>What this is page about?</h2>
	<p>A simple page put together using HTML. This page was started in the Micrsoft Notepad app then transfered to Github.<br>
	My goal is to learn the skills required to find a job i enjoy actually doing.<br>
	This website will hopefully serve the purpose of showing how far my skills have come from start to finish. Eventually there will be a<br>
	link to an additional html where i will be able to log notes of changes that i've made to the website, much like Github does.</p>

	<h3>Why would i make this page?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>To learn HTML!</li>
		<li>To show off.</li>
		<ol>
			<li>To my boss.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Because I hate my job.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>To my friends.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Because they'll never be as cool as me.</li>
					<li>And because i hate my job.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>To anyone i want!</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Because we're all looking for approval in the wrong places.</li>
					<li>And the obligitory, because i hate my job.</li>
				</ul>
		</ol>
		<li>Because i have nothing better to do on night shifts and learning a skill like HTML might help me find a job i don't hate.</li>
		<li>Did i mention i hate my job?</li>
	</ul>
