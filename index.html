	<h2>What this is page about?</h2>
	<p>A simple page put together using HTML.</p>

	<h3>Why would i make this page?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>To learn HTML!</li>
		<li>To show off.</li>
		<ol>
			<li>To my boss.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Because I hate my job.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>To my friends.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Because they'll never be as cool as me.</li>
					<li>And because i hate my job.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>To anyone i want!</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Because we're all looking for approval in the wrong places.</li>
					<li>And the obligitory, because i hate my job.</li>
				</ul>
		</ol>
		<li>Because i have nothing better to do on night shifts and learning a skill like HTML might help me find a job i don't hate.</li>
