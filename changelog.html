        Changes made today:
            <ul>
              <li>Added the light green background to the website. Then had to move the syntax from body to head for proper formatting.</li>
              <li>After the custom domain was properly distributed I linked the domain to the Github file directory.</li>
              <li>Created a file named form.html to link to the main webpage. This form will be functionally useless for the time being but may end up<br>
              serving a purpose some day. For now its just to learn.</li>
              <li>Wrote the script for the form in form.html</li>
              <li>Attempted to change text color on header 1 to light blue</li>
